When it comes to the top-tier side-by-side machines, the battle between the Can-Am Maverick and the Polaris RZR is one that never goes out of style. Both brands have carved out their place in the off-road world, and their flagship models—the Maverick X3 and the Polaris RZR Pro R—are considered the crème de la crème of dune-ripping, trail-shredding machines. But which one truly reigns supreme? Let’s dive deep into the specs, performance, and what makes each of these beasts stand out to even the most seasoned off-roaders.

Engine Power & Performance
Can-Am Maverick X3 Turbo RR
Engine: 195hp, 3-cylinder, 900cc turbocharged engine.
Torque: 135 lb-ft.
Top Speed: 85-90 mph (depending on terrain).
Transmission: CVT with quick-shift paddle controls.
Why It’s a Beast: The Maverick X3 is all about raw power and getting the most out of that turbocharged engine. Can-Am has long been known for pushing the limits when it comes to engine performance, and the X3 is no exception. The 195 horsepower is a true powerhouse, and with torque that peaks at 135 lb-ft, this machine is built to tackle everything from steep dunes to rough trails. When you hit that gas pedal, the acceleration is instantaneous, which is perfect for tackling those massive jumps at Glamis or taking on tight, technical trails at high speed.

Polaris RZR Pro R
Engine: 225hp, 4-cylinder, 2.0L naturally aspirated engine.
Torque: 144 lb-ft.
Top Speed: 80-85 mph.
Transmission: PVT automatic with Lock & Ride technology.
Why It’s a Beast: Polaris has taken a more refined, engineering-heavy approach with the Pro R’s engine. The 225 horsepower from the 2.0L 4-cylinder engine isn't just about brute force—it's engineered for precision and long-lasting performance. Polaris leaned heavily into a powertrain that's tuned for endurance, providing smooth, predictable power delivery while maintaining the ability to rip up sand dunes and tackle rock gardens with ease. The Pro R’s 144 lb-ft of torque allows for optimal control at lower RPMs, giving you better throttle response when you need it most.

Winner: The Pro R edges ahead in terms of peak horsepower, but if you’re looking for sheer turbocharged excitement, the X3 Turbo RR has the instant-on performance. Both are powerhouses, but the Pro R’s power feels a bit more refined, whereas the X3 has a wilder, more aggressive nature.

Suspension & Handling
Maverick X3 Turbo RR
Suspension: Dynamic Power Steering (DPS) with Fox 2.5 Podium shocks.
Travel: 22 inches front, 24 inches rear.
Wheelbase: 102 inches.
What You’ll Feel: Can-Am has always been known for their suspension setups, and the X3 delivers with its Fox shocks that offer excellent damping and rebound control. Whether you're blasting through whoops, hitting big jumps, or navigating rough terrain, the X3 handles it all with remarkable stability. The longer suspension travel gives it an edge when it comes to absorbing big impacts at high speed. 

RZR Pro R
Suspension: Walker Evans Racing, 3.0 shocks with high-speed compression adjustment.
Travel: 24 inches front, 29 inches rear.
Wheelbase: 104 inches.
What You’ll Feel: The Pro R suspension setup is no joke, with some of the longest suspension travel in the market. Polaris threw everything at the Pro R to ensure it could handle just about anything you throw at it, from deep sand to sharp rock ledges. The Walker Evans shocks with high-speed compression adjustments provide incredible control, meaning you can dial in your suspension for any kind of terrain. The longer travel, especially in the rear, allows the Pro R to absorb massive drops and high-speed runs with confidence.

Winner: The Pro R takes the suspension crown here, especially with its massive rear travel. If you're tackling high-speed desert runs or steep climbs, the Pro R's setup offers a smoother, more controlled ride.

Durability & Build Quality
Maverick X3 Turbo RR
Chassis: Reinforced steel with a steel roll cage.
Body: Injection-molded plastic with a focus on impact resistance.
Frame: 4130 Chromoly steel for strength.
What You’ll Feel: The X3 is a tank. It’s made for roughing it in tough environments, and its chassis feels like it can take a beating. Can-Am has focused on durability without sacrificing weight, so it’s a perfect balance for riders who want both strength and performance.

RZR Pro R
Chassis: Heavy-duty boxed-steel frame with advanced tubular construction.
Body: ABS plastic with advanced impact-resistant composite panels.
Frame: High-strength steel and aluminum.
What You’ll Feel: Polaris has built the Pro R to last with a focus on both lightweight strength and rigidity. The Pro R’s frame feels super solid, and the use of aluminum and advanced materials keeps weight down without compromising durability. The Pro R is designed to take impacts at high speed without flexing or losing integrity.

Winner: Both are built tough, but the Pro R has a slight edge with its advanced construction materials. It’s engineered for both strength and weight distribution, meaning it’s ready to handle heavy-duty off-road action without weighing you down.

Technology & Features
Maverick X3 Turbo RR
Digital Display: 7.6-inch full-color display with real-time data.
Smart-Lok: Advanced 4WD with selectable modes for different terrains.
Rockford Fosgate Audio: Available as an option for premium sound in the dunes.
RZR Pro R
Digital Display: 7-inch LCD with navigation, ride diagnostics, and GPS.
Ride Command: Polaris' proprietary system that connects riders, tracks performance, and enables navigation.
LED Lights & Accessories: Standard LED accent lighting with options for off-road lights.
Winner: The Pro R has the edge when it comes to technology, particularly with the Ride Command system, which integrates navigation and allows for real-time diagnostics. For those who love gadgets and connectivity, the Pro R is the one to go for. However, the X3’s Smart-Lok system is a game-changer for varying terrains, providing a more customizable experience.

Price & Value
Maverick X3 Turbo RR: Starting around $27,000.
RZR Pro R: Starting around $29,000.
Winner: Both are premium machines, but the X3 Turbo RR offers a better value for those looking for raw power at a slightly lower price point. The Pro R, while a little pricier, justifies the cost with its refined suspension, technology, and build quality.

Conclusion: The Verdict
The Can-Am Maverick X3 Turbo RR and Polaris RZR Pro R are both powerhouse machines that cater to the most dedicated off-road enthusiasts. If you’re looking for a more raw, turbocharged experience with insane power and agility on the dunes, the X3 Turbo RR might be your pick. On the other hand, if you’re all about a refined, well-rounded, long-lasting machine with premium tech, suspension, and a smooth ride, the Pro R is built for you.

For those who want to take on just about any terrain with precision and an eye on the long haul, the Polaris RZR Pro R leads in the suspension and tech department, but the Can-Am Maverick X3 Turbo RR offers a wild, no-holds-barred ride that’s hard to beat.

No matter which you choose, you’re in for one heck of a ride.
